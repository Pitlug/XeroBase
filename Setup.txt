Here is documentation on what I went through to setup my project locally.

#Installing Python Dependecies for EasyOCR
- install: python3
- install: pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
    - If you are using debian based distro follow these commands:
        run:
        $ mkdir -p ~/.venvs
        $ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/foo
        $ ~/.venvs/foo/bin/python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
        $ ~/.venvs/foo/bin/python -m pip install easyocr
        # And if you want support for multiple langauges just add easyocr[chinese] full list of langauges can be found here and installation instructions: https://medium.com/@adityamahajan.work/easyocr-a-comprehensive-guide-5ff1cb850168
